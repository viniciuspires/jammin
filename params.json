Next file type must be MusicXML (using @saebekassebil's [MusicJSON to MusicXML Parser](https://github.com/saebekassebil/musicjson)).\r\n\r\nAlso, because it's _beautiful & ready_, [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) is used for the application frontend.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nBecause music composition should be free and social. That's our dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n### That's nice! Can I help you?\r\n\r\nOf course you can! :)\r\nIf you code [Coffescript](http://coffeescript.org/) (wich **is** Javascript), and know music scores, you definitely can message me through Github that I'll add you to the project.\r\nAlso, if you are a musician interested in the final product, and you want to stay tuned, or you wanna help us test Jammin', or you just wanna express your ideas for the project, mail us at (I'll tell the email later.), that we are happy to hear your advices about Jammin'.","tagline":"Open source Javascript music score editor.","google":""}
