Jammin' Online
============

Jammin' Online is a web music score editor and player, maintained by a community of musician programmers, free for our fellow musician users.

Currently, the project is being developed, thanks to [Google's Web Audio API suggestion to W3C](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html), and should be soon in beta testing.

## How?

The goal is to make a Javascript (actually, Coffescript) collaborative music composing web experience, tying together @mudcube's [MIDI.js](http://mudcu.be/midi-js/) and @0xfe's [VexFlow](http://vexflow.com/).

The file handled by the main project is MusicJSON (because it's JS). Next file type must be MusicXML (using @saebekassebil's [MusicJSON to MusicXML Parser](https://github.com/saebekassebil/musicjson)).

Also, because it's _beautiful & ready_, [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) is used for the application frontend.

## Why?

Because music composition should be free and social. That's our dream.

### That's nice! Can I help you?

Of course you can! :)
If you code [Coffescript](http://coffeescript.org/) (wich **is** Javascript), and know music scores, you definitely can message me through Github that I'll add you to the project.
Also, if you are a musician interested in the final product, and you want to stay tuned, or you wanna help us test Jammin', or you just wanna express your ideas for the project, mail us at (I'll tell the email later.), that we are happy to hear your advices about Jammin'.
